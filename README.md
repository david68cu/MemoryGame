Memory Game
===========

##How it works

Once you open the game you will have no card facing up , 0 stars , and an indication that you have make 0 move(or click)

When you click for the first time , a card will face up . 
Now you will click for a second time in search of a match.
If the second card you clicked is a match , them both cards will face up , and the background will turn red.

If there is no match , the second card will no face up , and the first one will also face down.

You should keep trying until you have all your card facing up.
