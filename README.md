Memory Game
===========

I created this game a few years back 
Being bored is not a good thing
It will simply allow you to change your mood while improving your mind
You can maybe hack it too ??

Send me any review you have to my email: david @ pymiami. org

## How it works

Once you open the game you will have no card facing up , 0 stars , and an indication that you have make 0 move(or click)

When you click for the first time , a card will face up . 

Now you will click for a second time in search of a match.
If the second card you clicked is a match , them both cards will face up , and the background will turn red.

If there is no match , the second card will no face up , and the first one will also face down.

You should keep trying until you have all your card facing up.

## Timers

A timmer will start once you clik your fist card .
It will show you how much time has elapsed since you started the game
This timmer will run until you win.Once you win , the timer will the message YOU WON!

At the end of the game , a dialog box will show you how much time has elapsed since you started the game

## Starts

Whe you star the game you are granted a 5 five star rating ( but you need to arrive to at least 16 clicks (8 moves) , as nobody can win this game in less than 16 clicks).So once you arrive to 16 clicks(8 moves) you are granted 5 stars. The stars will be reduced depending on how many clicks will take you to solve the game.

Example:

From 16-25 clicks : 5 stats
From 26-35 clicks : 4 stars
and so on ..

Once you win a dialog will hsow how many stars you got 
Also ,the stars will show in the panel

## Restarting the game
  Once you win , you can restart the game , cliked on Yes when asked
  Also you can restart the game any time , by cliking in the restart buttom in the panel

## Help
We have updated a video to show the game with all the new features
